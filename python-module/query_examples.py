    ["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS  \n       [0001]     This application claims benefit of Application Ser. No. 60/481,847, filed Dec. 31, 2003, and of Application Ser. No. 60/561,754, filed Apr. 13, 2004.  \n         [0002]     The entire contents of the aforementioned applications are herein incorporated by reference. The entire contents of all United States Patents and published and copending Applications mentioned below are also herein incorporated by reference. \n     \n    \n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \n       [0003]     This invention relates to electro-optic displays and to methods for driving such displays. More specifically, in one aspect this invention relates to electro-optic displays with simplified backplanes, and methods for driving such displays. In another aspect, this invention relates to electro-optic displays in which multiple types of electro-optic units are used to improve the colors available from the displays. The present invention is especially, though not exclusively, intended for use in electrophoretic displays.  \n         [0004]     Electro-optic displays comprise a layer of electro-optic material, a term which is used herein in its conventional meaning in the imaging art to refer to a material having first and second display states differing in at least one optical property, the material being changed from its first to its second display state by application of an electric field to the material. Although the optical property is typically color perceptible to the human eye, it may be another optical property, such as optical transmission, reflectance, luminescence or, in the case of displays intended for machine reading, pseudo-color in the sense of a change in reflectance of electromagnetic wavelengths outside the visible range.  \n         [0005]     In the displays of the present invention, the electro-optic medium will typically be a solid (such displays may hereinafter for convenience be referred to as \u201csolid electro-optic displays\u201d), in the sense that the electro-optic medium has solid external surfaces, although the medium may, and often does, have internal liquid- or gas-filled spaces. Thus, the term \u201csolid electro-optic displays\u201d includes encapsulated electrophoretic displays, encapsulated liquid crystal displays, and other types of displays discussed below."[:1024]+"...", "Analyze the following patent text and provide:\n1.
